    "# Credit Risk Classification Project\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. By accurately classifying applicants into high-risk and low-risk categories, financial institutions can make more informed lending decisions, ultimately reducing the risk of loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem Statement\n",
    "Loan defaults can lead to significant financial losses for lending institutions. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify loan applicants based on their likelihood of defaulting on a loan, using a dataset of applicant information and loan details.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    " - Data Exploration,Cleaning & preprocessing: Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare the data for modeling.\n",
    " - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis and Mutlivariate analysis on features.\n",
    " - Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features that improve the modelâ€™s predictive performance.\n",
    " - Model Training & Evaluation: Train multiple classification models, optimize them, and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics.\n",
    " - Model Interpretation: Identify the most important features contributing to the model's predictions and interpret the results.\n",
    " - Documentation & Presentation: Document the entire process and present the findings in a clear, concise manner.\n"
