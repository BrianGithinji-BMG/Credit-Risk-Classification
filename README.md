## Overview.
This repository contains a project that aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. By accurately classifying applicants into high-risk and low-risk categories, financial institutions can make more informed lending decisions, ultimately reducing the risk of loan defaults.
## Business Problem.
Loan defaults can lead to significant financial losses for lending institutions. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify loan applicants based on their likelihood of defaulting on a loan, using a dataset of applicant information and loan details.

## Objectives
### Main Objective
1. To build a predictive model that accurately classifies loan applicants into high-risk and low-risk categories.
### Specific Objectives
1. To identify and understand key features that influence loan default. i.e:

- Analyze the impact of age on loan default rates.
- Determine the income brackets most likely to default on loans.
- Investigate the effect of employment length on loan default.
- Identify the loan amounts that are most frequently defaulted.
- Assess how interest rates influence loan default likelihood.
- Evaluate the relationship between credit history length and loan default.
- Explore the influence of home ownership status on loan default.
- Examine which loan intents are most associated with defaults.

## Business Understanding
#### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**and contains various features related to the applicantâ€™s demographics, financial status, and loan details. The target variable is a binary indicator representing whether the applicant defaulted on the loan.
### Data Understanding
The Features in our dataset Include:
- Applicant Income: Income of the loan applicant.
- Loan Amount: Amount of loan requested.
- Credit History: History of credit transactions.
- Employment Status: Employment status of the applicant.
- Property Area: Area where the applicant owns property.
- Education: Education level of the applicant.
- Loan Status: **Target variable** indicating if the applicant defaulted.
