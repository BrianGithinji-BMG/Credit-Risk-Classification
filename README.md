# Credit-Risk-Classification
## Overview
This repository contains a project that aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. By accurately classifying applicants into high-risk and low-risk categories, financial institutions can make more informed lending decisions, ultimately reducing the risk of loan defaults.
## Problem Statement
Loan defaults can lead to significant financial losses for lending institutions. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify loan applicants based on their likelihood of defaulting on a loan, using a dataset of applicant information and loan details.
